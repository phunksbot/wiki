# ▫ FEATURES

<details>

<summary>VAULT CREATION</summary>

Vaults can be created by anyone for any NFT asset on Ethereum. Once a vault has been created, any user can then deposit eligible NFTs into the vault to mint a fungible NFT-backed token referred to as an "vToken".

<summary>MINTING vTOKENS</summary>

Anyone can deposit NFTs into an existing vault (or one they have created) in order to mint a fungible vToken that represents a 1:1 claim on a random NFT from within the vault.

<summary>REDEEMING</summary>

NFTX v2 allows you to easily redeem your [minted](https://phunks.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/nll/nftx.io/tutorials#tutorials) ERC20 Vault Tokens (vTokens) for either a random or targeted NFT within the vault.

Redemptions allow users to take ownership of an underlying NFT from within a vault. This means that a user can go to an AMM like Sushiswap, purchase a single vToken like PUNK and use that token to claim a random CryptoPhunk from the [PHUNK Vault](https://nftx.io/vault/0xb39185e33e8c28e0bb3dbbce24da5dea6379ae91/redeem/).

For an additional fee, usually 5% (1.05 vTokens), users are able to select a specific NFT from the vault.

<summary>STAKING</summary>

Earn fees from the vault, currently 100% of protocol fees are paid out to those that stake. Stakers also receive an ERC20 “xToken” like xPUNK that is a claim on the underlying staked SLP. We expect other projects to build use cases for these xTokens.

<details>

<summary>FLOOR PRICES</summary>

Users can then pool their minted vTokens in Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Sushiswap to create a liquid market for other users to trade. With liquidity and trading volume established, the NFT-backed vToken enters into price discovery and a "floor price" is discovered.

The floor price denotes the lowest price for a particular NFT. Users establish a floor price by minting and selling vTokens in markets where they consider their NFT to be overvalued.

For example, a user has 5 Hashmasks and values 2 of them highly. However, they consider the other 3 Hashmasks to be lower value than the market price for the Mask vault on Sushiswap. The user deposits these 3 Hashmasks and sells their 3 minted MASK tokens on Sushiswap, lowering its price and aiding price discovery.

The above process will continue until a floor price is achieved.
