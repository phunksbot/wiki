# V1

Philips are [Non Fungible Tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) from the [original CryptoPhunks contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa82f3a61f002f83eba7d184c50bb2a8b359ca1ce), deployed June 14, 2021. A week later, the team deployed the [v2 contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf07468ead8cf26c752c676e43c814fee9c8cf402) to remove the bonding curve pricing built into the original contract[\[1\]](https://phunks.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/resources/history). It was at this time that the metadata was wiped and the images were updated to “Philip the Intern” for all 1,004 NFTs minted before the migration to the new contract[\[1\]](https://phunks.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/resources/history).

On February 5, 2022, [Middlemarch](https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers) deployed a [wrapper](https://www.v1phunks.io/) for Philips, which restores the metadata and updates the image to the corresponding Phunk on a purple background[\[2\]](https://phunks.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/resources/open-sourced). Once your Philip is wrapped, you will receive your v1 Phunks (Wrapped) NFT and the Philip will be sent to the [V1 Cryptopunks (Wrapped) contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x235d49774139c218034c0571ba8f717773edd923).

Also in February, a fake v1 Phunks project was launched. This project claimed to be the original CryptoPhunk contract, but a quick scan of the contract on Etherscan proves their claims are false. To help clear up the confusion this caused in the marketplace and tell the history of Philips, [Vard](https://twitter.com/VardCrypto) created the [V1 Phunks (Philip Intern Project) Discord](https://discord.gg/CbzQZRhwEa) server on August 30, 2022.
