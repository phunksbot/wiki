<summary>MINTING</summary>

By adding your NFT to an NFTX vault you mint an ERC-20 token (vToken) that has a 1:1 claim on a random NFT inside the vault.

Unlike a non-fungible token (NFT), an ERC-20 is fungible (all tokens are the same) and this allows it to be:

* Instantly sold at an AMM (like Sushiswap)&#x20;
* Pooled in an AMM to earn trading fees
* Staking
* Used as collateral to borrow stablecoins

vTokens can be used to redeem a random vault NFT at any time.

<summary>REDEEMING</summary>

Redemptions allow users to take ownership of an underlying NFT from within a vault. This means that a user can go to an AMM like Sushiswap, purchase a single vToken like PUNK and use that token to claim a random CryptoPunk from the [PHUNK Vault](https://nftx.io/vault/0xb39185e33e8c28e0bb3dbbce24da5dea6379ae91/redeem/).

For an additional fee, usually 5% (1.05 vTokens), users are able to select a specific NFT from the vault.

<summary>STAKING</summary>

To stake on NFTX you first need to get a token for one of the NFTX vaults. In this example we're going to look at the AVASTR vault.

<summary>VAULT CREATION</summary>

Vault creation is at the heart of the NFTX protocol and allows users and content creators to begin [minting](https://phunks.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/nll/nftx.io/tutorials#tutorials) fungible ERC20 tokens for any NFT.

By creating NFT-backed ERC20 tokens, users can create liquid markets for otherwise illiquid NFTs whilst also earning fees and rewards from liquidity provision.

Protocol fees have been introduced in V2 of the NFTX.
