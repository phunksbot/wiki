## **What** is **NFTX**?

**NFTX** is a community-owned protocol and platform for creating non-fungible token (NFT)-backed ERC-20 tokens. Notably, **NFTX** powers the creation and trading of funds, tracking sought-after NFT collectibles such as BAYC, CryptoPunks, CryptoPhunks and others.

NFTX was launched in early January 2021 to provide an essential new service to the booming NFT sector through indexing of projects. Although these tokens represent index funds, they’re composable and fungible, which means they are interchangeable for other tokens, which distinguishes them from standard NFT protocols. These “funds” are actively traded on [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-exchange-dex) (DEXs) such as [Sushiswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/) and [Uniswap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/).

The platform’s unique value [proposition](https://dappradar.com/blog/nftx-the-first-nft-index-fund-has-arrived) is to bring NFTs to light to high-level individuals trading funds based on leading non-fungible tokens like [PUNK](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/punk/) and [AXIE](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/axie-infinity/) on Uniswap and other DEXs.

<details>

<summary>VAULT CREATION</summary>

Vaults can be created by anyone for any NFT asset on Ethereum. Once a vault has been created, any user can then deposit eligible NFTs into the vault to mint a fungible NFT-backed token referred to as an "vToken".

<summary>MINTING vTOKENS</summary>

Anyone can deposit NFTs into an existing vault (or one they have created) in order to mint a fungible vToken that represents a 1:1 claim on a random NFT from within the vault.

<details>

<summary>REDEEMING</summary>

NFTX v2 allows you to easily redeem your [minted](broken-reference) ERC20 Vault Tokens (vTokens) for either a random or targeted NFT within the vault.

Redemptions allow users to take ownership of an underlying NFT from within a vault. This means that a user can go to an AMM like Sushiswap, purchase a single vToken like PUNK and use that token to claim a random CryptoPhunk from the [PHUNK Vault](https://nftx.io/vault/0xb39185e33e8c28e0bb3dbbce24da5dea6379ae91/redeem/).

For an additional fee, usually 5% (1.05 vTokens), users are able to select a specific NFT from the vault.

<details>

<summary>STAKING</summary>

Earn fees from the vault, currently 100% of protocol fees are paid out to those that stake. Stakers also receive an ERC20 “xToken” like xPUNK that is a claim on the underlying staked SLP. We expect other projects to build use cases for these xTokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>FLOOR PRICES</summary>

Users can then pool their minted vTokens in Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Sushiswap to create a liquid market for other users to trade. With liquidity and trading volume established, the NFT-backed vToken enters into price discovery and a "floor price" is discovered.

The floor price denotes the lowest price for a particular NFT. Users establish a floor price by minting and selling vTokens in markets where they consider their NFT to be overvalued.

For example, a user has 5 Hashmasks and values 2 of them highly. However, they consider the other 3 Hashmasks to be lower value than the market price for the Mask vault on Sushiswap. The user deposits these 3 Hashmasks and sells their 3 minted MASK tokens on Sushiswap, lowering its price and aiding price discovery.

The above process will continue until a floor price is achieved.
