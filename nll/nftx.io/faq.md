<summary>What is NFTX.io?</summary>

NFTX is a platform for making ERC20 tokens that are backed by NFT collectibles. These tokens are called vault tokens, and (like all ERC20s) they are fungible and composable. With NFTX, it is possible to create and trade tokens based on your favorite collectibles such as [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [CryptoPhunks](../notlarvalabs/), and [Avastars](https://avastars.io/), right from an exchange.

NFTX's mission is to become the primary issuer of NFT vault tokens, allowing anyone to trade & invest in NFT markets without needing the underlying knowledge and expertise required when investing in individual assets. By doing so, NFTX will function as a black hole for NFT assets.

<summary>Who is working on NFTX.io?</summary>

NFTX is built by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) - a group of community members, contributors, and core members closely aligned to build the primary NFT liquidity hub. As NFTX is an open organization, anyone anywhere may join to provide expertise and/or additional resources with the goal to grow NFTXs' success.

<summary>Does NFTX.io charge any fees?</summary>

[NFTX V1](https://v1.nftx.org) does not charge any fees.

[NFTX V2](https://app.nftx.org) allows vault creators to charge fees based on minting and redeeming NFTs in and out of the vaults. There are three fee options in V2 and are set to the following defaults for all DAO and new vault creations

1. 5% Minting Fee&#x20;
2. 0% Random Redemption Fee
3. 5% Targeted Redemption Fee

These fees are distributed as rewards to the liquidity providers for the vault.

Anyone providing liquidity to vaults can bypass minting fees by using a zap to automatically include liquidity. Learn more in the [minting tutorial](broken-reference).

<summary>Can you get rewards from using NFTX.io?</summary>

Yes. To encourage more liquidity for the vaults all fees that are generated from Buys and Sells (Minting and Redeeming) are passed to anyone that is staking their SLP against that vault. These rewards are paid out on a block-by-block basis, and are paid in the vault tokens you are using to stake.

You can see the APR for each of the different vaults on the [NFTX Staking](https://app.nftx.org/staking/) page.
