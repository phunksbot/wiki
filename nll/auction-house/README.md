# ðŸŸ§ AUCTION HOUSE

[CryptoPhunks Auction House](https://twitter.com/PhunksAuction) was built by [Chopper](https://twitter.com/chopper\_\_dad) and [Kenobi](https://twitter.com/OG\_Kenobi\_Hello) with the purpose of facilitating perpetual auctions for CryptoPhunks held in the [Treasury Vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61f874551c69f0e40c9f55219107b408c989adec). All Ethereum collected from settled auctions will remain in the treasury under direction of the community.

There are 496 CryptoPhunks that used to belong to original Phunk devs, now they belong to Phunks community and one will be auctioned every 3 days until they are all sold-out. All proceeds from Auctions go to community [Treasury Vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61f874551c69f0e40c9f55219107b408c989adec) that is here to support and expand web3 movement Phunks stand for.
