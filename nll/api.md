# ðŸŸ¨ FLYWHEEL

The FlyWheel is a DAPP that appraises mid- and top-tier CryptoPhunks and gives holders the option to sell them to the Treasury at a small discount to fair market value in a trustless, fair, and automatic way.

CryptoPhunks FlyWheel was built by [Hwonder](https://twitter.com/hWonderofWorld) and [MiddleMarch](https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers) with the purpose of providing access to liquidity for CryptoPhunks.
