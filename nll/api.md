# ðŸŸ¨ FLYWHEEL

The FlyWheel is a [DAPP](https://www.phunks.pro/) that appraises mid- and top-tier CryptoPhunks and gives holders the option to sell them to the Treasury at a small discount to fair market value in a trustless, fair, and automatic way.

CryptoPhunks FlyWheel was built by [Hwonder](https://twitter.com/hWonderofWorld) and [MiddleMarch](https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers) with the purpose of providing access to liquidity to CryptoPhunks community and in the process enriching Phunks treasury with rare phunks, that eventually enter the loop for future public auctions using in house built [auction house](auction-house/).
