# ðŸŸ¨ FLYWHEEL

The FlyWheel is a [DAPP](https://www.phunks.pro/) that appraises mid- and top-tier CryptoPhunks and gives holders the option to sell them to the Treasury at a small discount to fair market value in a trustless, fair, and automatic way.

CryptoPhunks FlyWheel was built by [Hwonder](https://twitter.com/hWonderofWorld) and [MiddleMarch](https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers) with the purpose of providing access to liquidity for CryptoPhunks community and in the process it enriches Phunks treasury with rare phunks, that eventually enter the loop for future public auctions using [phunks auction house](auction-house/).
