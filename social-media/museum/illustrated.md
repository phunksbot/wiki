# ➖ ILLUSTRATED

The satirical Storyboard based on CryptoPhunk matter by [@VeryWilliam3](https://twitter.com/VeryWilliam3)

![The illustrations are 100% digitally hand drawn byme; an Italian illustrator and Phunk holder. My satirical illustrations work to create a storyboard that chronicles the most relevant matters of the CryptoPhunks story. However, the story does not end with me – thanks to the use of a Creative Comm ons CC0 license, my illustrations and even the entire storyboard are available for free use by the community.](<../../.gitbook/assets/1\_9MVjDTtPySmAQ\_K0nP6OTg@2x (1).jpeg>)

![Phunks Phacts was created with the aim of informing through the visual arts and making the events associated with cryptophunks better understood. It does not want to be a stance and limits itself to telling facts that really happened without being biased. The goal is to raise the power of the decentralization, which must be the ultimate goal that this environment inherits from the blockchain.](../../.gitbook/assets/1\_kYwijlTQwYZH9Q7jg\_rhUA@2x.jpeg)
